# Philippine-Historical-Petroleum-Production
This repository contains Python code for plotting historical petroleum production data in the Philippines from 1979 to 2021. The code uses the Plotly library to create interactive plots that visualize the data over time. This can be helpful for understanding how petroleum production has changed over the years, and for identifying potential problems or opportunities.

## Features
- Interactive visualization: Explore the historical petroleum production data plot with zooming, panning, and hovering capabilities.
- Data visualization: Display different aspects of the petroleum production data, such as the total production, the production of different types of petroleum, or the production by oilfield.
- Data customization: Adjust plot properties, such as colors, fonts, and titles, to customize the visualization.
- Easy to use: The code is easy to use and does not require any special knowledge of Python.

## Data Credits
The data set for this repository was sourced from the Department of Energy in the Philippines, available on their website: https://www.doe.gov.ph/energy-information-resources?q=energy-resources/petroleum-statistics. Accessed August 21, 2023.

## Contributing
Contributions to this open-source project are welcome. If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

I hope that these plots will be a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in understanding the petroleum industry in the Philippines.
