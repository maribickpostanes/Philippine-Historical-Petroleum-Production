# Philippine-Historical-Petroleum-Production
This repository contains Python code for plotting historical petroleum production data in the Philippines from 1979 to 2021. The code uses the Plotly library to create interactive plots that visualize the data over time. This can be helpful for understanding how petroleum production has changed over the years, and for identifying potential problems or opportunities.
